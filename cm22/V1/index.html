                <h1>Sebastian Solace</h1>
                <h2>Appearance</h2>
                <p>Sebastian’s body is shaped similarly to that of a sea snake, in that it is elongated with blue scales. At the end of his body is a large tail fin. Sebastian’s skin is a light blue. His torso is humanoid, with two larger arms and one smaller arm on his left side. Sebastian’s hands are humanoid, although he only has four fingers with claw-like ends. Sebastian’s face retains a humanoid face (which is mostly always smiling) with fish-like features, such as an anglerfish bulb on his forehead, fin-like appendages on his head, sharp teeth, a fish-like mouth, and a third eye on his right side. He also has a gold/yellow ring on his pinkie finger (lower left arm).</p>
                <p>Sebastian is seen in-game wearing a dark brown jacket with a white undershirt and a white cravat. He also wears various belts and accessories such as a holster with a gun, a portable security scrambling device, a bandage around his smallest arm, a bandolier and a small pin with a photo of a cat on it. Sebastian’s tail has several pouches that hold the supplies that he sells to the player!</p>
